It has been quite a long time since I have posted anything to this site. A month, to be exact. After a pretty harsh first half of my summer holidays, I have been busy catching up with some summer pleasures in it&#8217;s second half.

With my parents and my brother, I spent a week at our cottage in [Low Tatras][1]. I finally got the chance to charge my internal batteries.

After returning from the mountains a friend asked me if I would join him on his trip to Prague. He has never been there before and I just could not say no. The trip was perfect and I&#8217;ve got some nice pictures, so maybe I&#8217;ll post them somewhere.

Anyway &#8211; I promise, I will write more content for this blog now and I will also try keeping it less personal and more technical. I&#8217;ve got some fun things on the burner, so stay tuned.
