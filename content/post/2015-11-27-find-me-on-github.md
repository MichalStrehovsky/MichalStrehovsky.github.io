I haven&#8217;t been exactly active on this blog ever since I got a full time job, really. My full time job recently became open source though, so if anyone is interested in what I&#8217;m doing, they can [follow me on GitHub][1].

We&#8217;re working there on a cross platform runtime and a native compiler for .NET Core. The [project][2] is still in the very early stages, but you can already use it to build a C# Hello World command line program and compile it into a native console app for Windows, OSX, or Linux. The console app you build is a fully native program with no .NET dependencies (the only runtime you need is the C runtime!). It&#8217;s lean and launches fast. It&#8217;s the thing C# developers have been dreaming about for years.
