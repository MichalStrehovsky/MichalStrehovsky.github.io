According to [Scott Guthrie&#8217;s blog][1], Microsoft will release the source code of .NET framework libraries together with .NET 3.5 and Visual Studio 2008 release later this year.

Nice. This means no more uncommented disassemblies of extended .NET classes from [Lutz Roeder&#8217;s .NET Reflector][2] (even though it&#8217;s a wonderful tool when you don&#8217;t have the source code, having the source code is better).
