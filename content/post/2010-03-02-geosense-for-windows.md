Okay, quick post because this is too awesome to not to write about it. Rafael Rivera from withinwindows.com and Long Zheng from istartedsomething.com have put together a driver for Windows Location API in Windows 7. The driver provides geolocation information for location-aware Windows applications using Google&#8217;s Location Services. All it needs is your WiFi turned on (or your IP address, but that&#8217;s less precise) and internet connection.

I am really impressed by the accuracy of thins thing (2 locations tested so far and the accuracy was ~30 meters). The best thing: it&#8217;s free. Go grab it from [geosenseforwindows.com][1].
