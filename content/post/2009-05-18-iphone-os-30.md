There has been a lot of buzz about the coming iPhone OS 3.0 in the last few weeks, but I never really had time to look at the new features before today. According to the [Apple website][1], these will be the key new features of the new &#8220;most advanced mobile OS&#8221;:

  * The ability to search your iPhone
  * Cut, copy, and paste
  * Send photos, contacts, audio files, and location via MMS
  * Read and compose email and text messages in landscape

Windows Mobile could do all of this for _ages_. I think I will spend the rest of the day searching my HTC Touch Diamond, cutting, copying and pasting text, and composing e-mails in landscape mode, so as to be prepared when the new iPhone OS arrives to my iPod Touch.

If these are the real highlights of the new iPhone OS, then Apple is definitely losing it&#8217;s position of an innovator. The new iPhone OS will only address features that were criticised in reviews since iPhone OS 1.0. It&#8217;s not even worth increasing the major version number.
